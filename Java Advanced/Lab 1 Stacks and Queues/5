//The printer queue is a simple way to control the order of files sent to a printer device. We know that
//a single printer can be shared between multiple devices. So to preserve the order of the files sent, 
//we can use queue. Write down a program which takes filenames until "print" command is received. Then
//as output print the filenames in the order of printing. Some of the tasks may be canceled if you receive
//"cancel" you have to remove the first file to be printed. If there is no current file to be printed 
//print "Printer is on standby".

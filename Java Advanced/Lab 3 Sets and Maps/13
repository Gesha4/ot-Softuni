//Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers. You are free to choose the 
//manner in which the data is entered; each entry should have just one name and one number (both of them strings). If you 
//receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, simply update its number. After filling this simple phonebook, upon 
//receiving the command "search", your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name and print her details
//in format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn`t found, print "Contact {name} does not exist."

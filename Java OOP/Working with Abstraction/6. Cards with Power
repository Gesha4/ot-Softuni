/*Create a program that generates a deck of cards (class Card) which have a power. The power of a card is calculated
by adding the power of its rank plus the power of its suit. Rank powers are as follows: (ACE - 14, TWO - 2, THREE - 3, FOUR - 4,
FIVE - 5, SIX - 6, SEVEN - 7, EIGHT - 8, NINE - 9, TEN - 10, JACK - 11, QUEEN - 12, KING - 13). Suit powers are as follows: 
(CLUBS - 0, DIAMONDS - 13, HEARTS - 26, SPADES - 39). You will get a command consisting of two lines. On the first line you will
receive the Rank of the card and on the second line you will get the suit of the card.
Print the output in the format "Card name: ACE of SPADES; Card power: 53".*/

/*Model an application which contains a class Ferrari and an interface. Your task is simple, you have a car - Ferrari, its model
is "488-Spider" and it has a driver. Your Ferrari should have functionality to use brakes and push the gas pedal. When the 
brakes are pushed down print "Brakes!", and when the gas pedal is pushed down - "Zadu6avam sA!". As you may have guessed this 
functionality is typical for all cars, so you should implement an interface to describe it. Your task is to create a Ferrari
and set the driver's name to the passed one in the input. After that, print the info. 
<<Interface>>

/*It’s the future, you’re the ruler of a totalitarian dystopian society inhabited by citizens and robots, since you’re afraid 
of rebellions you decide to implement strict control of who enters your city. Your soldiers check the Ids of everyone who enters
and leaves. You will receive from the console an unknown amount of lines until the command "End" is received, on each line there 
will be the information for either a citizen or a robot who tries to enter your city in the format "<name> <age> <id>" for 
citizens and "<model> <id>" for robots. After the end command on the next line you will receive a single number representing
the last digits of fake ids, all citizens or robots whose Id ends with the specified digits must be detained.*/

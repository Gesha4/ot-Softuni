//Write a program, which keeps information about products and their prices. Each product has a name, a 
//price and its quantity. If the product doesn`t exist yet, add it with its starting quantity. If you 
//receive a product, which already exists, increase its quantity by the input quantity and if its price
//is different, replace the price as well. You will receive products` names, prices and quantities on 
//new lines. Until you receive the command "buy", keep adding items. When you do receive the command 
//"buy", print the items with their names and total price of all the products with that name.
//Input
//Until you receive "buy", the products come in the format: "{name} {price} {quantity}"
//The product data is always delimited by a single space
//Output
//Print information about each product, following the format:
//"{productName} -> {totalPrice}"
//Format the average grade to the 2-nd decimal place

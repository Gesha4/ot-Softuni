//Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked master Ivan Cho to buy the 
//needed equipment. The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. 
//The equipment for the Padawan contains lightsabers,belts and robes. You will be given 
//the amount of money Ivan Cho has, the number of students and the prices of each item. You
//have to help Ivan Cho calculate if the money he has is enough to buy all of the equipment,
//or how much more money he needs. Because the lightsabres sometimes brake, Ivan Cho should 
//buy 10% more, rounded up to the next integer. Also, every sixth belt is free.

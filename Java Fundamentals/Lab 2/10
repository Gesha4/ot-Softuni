//As a MOBA challenger player, Pesho has the bad habit to trash his PC when he loses a game 
//and rage quits. His gaming setup consists of headset, mouse, keyboard and display. You will
//receive Pesho`s lost games count. Every second lost game, Pesho trashes his headset. Every 
//third lost game, Pesho trashes his mouse. When Pesho trashes both his mouse and headset in 
//the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard. Every second time, when he trashes his 
//keyboard, he also trashes his display. You will receive the price of each item in his 
//gaming setup. Calculate his rage expenses for renewing his gaming equipment.

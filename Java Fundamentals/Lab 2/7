//You task is to calculate the total price of a purchase from a vending machine. Until you 
//receive "Start" you will be given different coins that are being inserted in the machine.
//You have to sum them in order to have the total money inserted. There is a problem though.
//Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins. If someone tries to 
//insert some other coins you have to display "Cannot accept {money}", where the value is 
//formated to the second digit after the decimal point and not add it to the total money. 
//On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase. 
//Your machine has however only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke". The prices are:
//2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively. If the person tries to purchase a not existing product
//print “Invalid product”. Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product for 
//which he doesn`t have money. In that case print "Sorry, not enough money". If the person
//purchases a product successfully print "Purchased {product name}". After the “End” command 
//print the money that are left formatted to the second decimal point in the format 
//"Change: {money left}".

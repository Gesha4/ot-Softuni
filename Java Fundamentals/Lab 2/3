//You are given a group of people, type of the group, on which day of the week they are going 
//to stay. Based on that information calculate how much they have to pay and print that 
//price on the console. Use the table below. In each cell is the price for a single person. 
//The output should look like that: "Total price: {price}". The price should be formatted
//to the second decimal point.There are also discounts based on some conditions:
//- Students – if the group is bigger than or equal to 30 people you should reduce the total 
//price by 15%
//- Business – if the group is bigger than or equal to 100 people 10 of them can stay for free.
//- Regular – if the group is bigger than or equal 10 and less than or equal to 20 reduce 
//the total price by 5%

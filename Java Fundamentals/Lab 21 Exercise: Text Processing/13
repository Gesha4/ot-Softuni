//You are given a collection of tickets separated by commas and spaces. You need to check every one of them
//if it has a winning combination of symbols. A valid ticket should have exactly 20 characters. The winning
//symbols are '@', '#', '$' and '^'. But in order for a ticket to be a winner the symbol should 
//uninterruptedly repeat for at least 6 times in both the tickets left half and the tickets right half. 
//For example, a valid winning ticket should be something like this: "Cash$$$$$$Ca$$$$$$sh" 
//The left half "Cash$$$$$$" contains "$$$$$$", which is also contained in the tickets right half "Ca$$$$$$sh".
//A winning ticket should contain symbols repeating up to 10 times in both halves, which is considered a 
//Jackpot (for example: "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$").
//Input
//The input will be read from the console. The input consists of a single line containing all tickets separated by commas and one or more white spaces in the format:
//•	"{ticket}, {ticket}, … {ticket}"
//Output
//Print the result for every ticket in the order of their appearance, each on a separate line in the format:
//•	Invalid ticket - "invalid ticket"
//•	No match - "ticket "{ticket}" - no match"
//•	Match with length 6 to 9 - "ticket "{ticket}" - {match length}{match symbol}"
//•	Match with length 10 - "ticket "{ticket}" - {match length}{match symbol} Jackpot!"

//You will be given two hands of cards, which will be integer numbers. Assume that you have two players. You have to
//find out the winning deck and respectively the winner. You start from the beginning of both hands. Compare the cards 
//from the first deck to the cards from the second deck. The player, who has bigger card, takes both cards and puts them 
//at the back of his hand - the second player`s card is last, and the first person`s card (the winning one) is before it
//(second to last) and the player with smaller card must remove the card from his deck. If both players` cards have the 
//same values - no one wins, and the two cards must be removed from the decks. The game is over when one of the decks is
//left without any cards. You have to print the winner on the console and the sum of the left cards: "Player {one/two}
//wins! Sum: {sum}".

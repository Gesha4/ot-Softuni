//Write a program that keeps track of the guests that are going to a house party.
//On the first input line you are going to receive how many commands you are going to have. 
//On the next lines you are going to receive some of the following inputs:
//- "{name} is going!"
//- "{name} is not going!"
//If you receive the first type of input, you have to add the person if he/she is not in the list.
//(If he/she is in the list print on the console: "{name} is already in the list!"). If you receive
//the second type of input, you have to remove the person if he/she is in the list. (If not print:
//"{name} is not in the list!"). At the end print all guests.

//Let`s take a break and visit the game bar at SoftUni. It is about time for the people behind the bar
//to go home and you are the person who has to draw the line and calculate the money from the products
//that were sold throughout the day. Until you receive a line with text "end of shift" you will be given
//lines of input. But before processing that line you have to do some validations first.
//Each valid order should have a customer, product, count and a price:
//•	Valid customer's name should be surrounded by '%' and must start with a capital letter, followed by lower-case letters
//•	Valid product contains any word character and must be surrounded by '<' and '>' 
//•	Valid count is an integer, surrounded by '|'
//•	Valid price is any real number followed by '$'
//The parts of a valid order should appear in the order given: customer, product, count and a price.
//Between each part there can be other symbols, except ('|', '$', '%' and '.')
//For each valid line print on the console: "{customerName}: {product} - {totalPrice}"
//When you receive "end of shift" print the total amount of money for the day rounded to 2 decimal 
//places in the following format: "Total income: {income}".

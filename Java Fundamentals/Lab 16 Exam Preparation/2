//Create a program that calculates the water that is needed to put out a "fire cell", based on the given information about its
//"fire level" and how much it gets affected by water. First, you will be given the level of fire inside the cell with the integer
//value of the cell, which represents the needed water to put out the fire.  They will be given in the following format:
//"{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}#{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}#{typeOfFire} = {valueOfCell}……"
//Afterwards you will receive the amount of water you have for putting out the fires. There is a range of fire for each of the 
//fire types, and if a cell’s value is below or exceeds it, it is invalid and you don’t need to put it out.
//Type of Fire	Range
//High	81 - 125
//Medium	51 - 80
//Low	1 - 50
//If a cell is valid, you have to put it out by reducing the water with its value. Putting out fire also takes effort and you 
//need to calculate it. Its value is equal to 25% of the cell’s value. In the end you will have to print the total effort. Keep 
//putting out cells until you run out of water. If you don’t have enough water to put out a given cell – skip it and try the next
//one. In the end, print the cells you have put out in the following format:
//"Cells:
// - {cell1}
// - {cell2}
// - {cell3}
//……
// - {cellN}"
//"Effort: {effort}"
//In the end, print the total fire you have put out from all of the cells in the following format: "Total Fire: {totalFire}"

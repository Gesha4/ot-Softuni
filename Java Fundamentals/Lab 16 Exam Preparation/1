//Write a program that calculates the needed provisions for a quest in the woods.
//First you will receive the days of the adventure, the count of the players and the group’s energy. Afterwards, you will receive 
//the following provisions per day for one person:
//	Water
//	Food
//The group calculates how many supplies they’d need for the adventure and take that much water and food.
//Every day they chop wood and lose a certain amount of energy. For each of the days, you are going to receive the energy loss 
//from chopping wood. The program should end If the energy reaches 0 or less. 
//Every second day they drink water, which boosts their energy with 5% of their current energy and at the same time drops their 
//water supplies by 30% of their current water.
//Every third day they eat, which reduces their food supplies by the following amount:
//{currentFood} / {countOfPeople} and at the same time raises their group’s energy by 10%.
//The chopping of wood, the drinking of water, and the eating happen in the order above.
//If they have enough energy to finish the quest, print the following message:
//"You are ready for the quest. You will be left with - {energyLevel} energy!"
//If they run out of energy print the following message and the food and water they were left with before they ran out of energy: 
//"You will run out of energy. You will be left with {food} food and {water} water."
//•	On the 1st line, you are going to receive a number N - the days of the adventure – an integer in the range [1…100]
//•	On the 2nd line – the count of players – an integer in the range [0 – 1000]
//•	On the 3rd line - the group’s energy – a real number in the range [1 - 50000]
//•	On the 4th line – water per day for one person – a real number [0.00 – 1000.00]
//•	On the 5th line – food per day for one person – a real number [0.00 – 1000.00]
//•	On the next N lines – one for each of the days – the amount of energy loss– a real number in the range [0.00 - 1000]
//•	You will always have enough food and water.
